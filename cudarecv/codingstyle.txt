CODING STYLE FOR GNSS C++ REAL TIME RECEIVER

Git Repo branches:
Master  -
Stable  - Pulls from Stable as and when we want to bump up a new version
Beta    - Pulls from Dev and run test scripts here
Dev     - Merges with new code and initial tests
others  - Can be by topics of certain parts to be worked on

1. Use Egyptian brackets with 1 space before opening bracket
2. Use SPACES instead of TABs for indentation
3. Indentation = 4 spaces
4. Each line not more that 80 columns
5. No Trailing spaces in each line
6. Naming convention: thisName, ThisName, or This_Name?
7. Header files: #ifndef INC__SOMENAME_H_
   Rationale being that compiler of standard libraries use __SAMENAME. So if
   we do INC__SOMENAME_H it wouldn't conflict.
8. Comments style? need to work with Doxygen


Example:


In .h file:


/** \brief Some brief description
 *
 *  More detailed description.
 *  \param  arg whatever arg does..
 *  \return some kind of error code
 */
int FunctionName(char arg);



In .cpp file:


int FunctionName(char arg) {
    nop();

    nop();

    if (a < b) {
        nop();
    } else {
        nop();
    }

    /* The following code does
    blah blah blah */
    switch (a) {
    case 1:                 // its okay to
        break;              // have comments on the
    case 2:                 // right but needs to
        break;              // be column aligned
    default:                // within a function?
        break;              // or a file?
    }

    return 0;
}
