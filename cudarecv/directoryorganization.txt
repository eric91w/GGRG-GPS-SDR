Projects:
-- console    Console part of program
-- modules    Modules
-- dsp        DSP namespace related definitions
-- gnssrecv   Program entry point
-- auxil      Auxiliary utilities (renamed from aux to not conflict with Windows reserved naming)

Per-project:
inc         All header files
src         All source files. Same sub-directories as inc
tests       Source Code or scripts for testing various stuff

Note: Modules are part of the dsp namespace. But for organization of
directories, modules are in their own folder to keep the implementation code
of various gps related modules. The dsp directory contains other code that
does the implementation of the generic dspflow infrastructure.
